# audio_map_explorer
experimental tool for mapping and visualizing song structure.  
it analyzes tempo, chroma, and brightness features to create a color-coded timeline of energy and tone shifts.  
originally built as part of my internal audio-structure visualizer project; this version is a lightweight public prototype.

## usage
```bash
python audio_map_explorer.py sample.wav
```
